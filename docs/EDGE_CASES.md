# Edge-Case Inventory & Hand-Verified Expected Values

Every scenario below becomes one or more named unit tests. Expected values here were
computed by hand; **Claude Code must re-verify each by hand before encoding it** (the
test asserts the doc's value; if code and doc disagree, resolve on paper first — never
adjust the expected value to match the code).

All amounts in cents in tests; shown here in dollars for readability.
Calendar references use real 2026 dates (June 13, 2026 = Saturday; June 15 = Monday).

## §Cash-Needed Engine

### A. Autopay card — included in cash, excluded from action
- Today 2026-06-10. Checking $3,400.00, no scheduled flows, no pending.
- Amex: statement $2,100.00, due 2026-06-15, autopay = STATEMENT_BALANCE.
- Chase: statement $2,712.33, due 2026-06-15, no autopay.
- **Expected:** required by 2026-06-15 = **$4,812.33**; shortfall = **$1,412.33**;
  transfer recommendation = **$1,450.00** (round UP to next $50) by **2026-06-12**
  (1 business day before due); action list contains only Chase (Amex marked "autopay
  handles payment — ensure funds present"). Amex counted exactly once.
- Variant A2: Amex autopay = MINIMUM ($35.00), scenario PAY_IN_FULL → required still
  $4,812.33 but action list = Chase full + Amex top-up of $2,065.00 ($2,100 − $35
  autopay).
- Variant A3: Amex autopay = FIXED_AMOUNT $500.00 → autopay covers $500, user action
  $1,600.00 remainder; total cash unchanged.

### B. Mid-cycle manual payment
- Statement $1,000.00; CardPayment $400.00 on 2026-06-05 applied to that statement.
- **Expected remaining due = $600.00.**
- B2 (overpayment): statement $500.00, payments $600.00 → remaining = **$0.00**
  (floored; never negative cash need).

### C. Statement not yet generated → estimate
- No statement; current balance $1,234.00; cycle closes 2026-06-20, due ~25 days later.
- **Expected:** estimated due **$1,234.00**, `isEstimated = true`, assumptions array
  contains an "estimated from current balance" string, UI shows "est." badge.

### D. Two cards due the same day
- Card1 $1,234.56 + Card2 $765.44 both due 2026-06-15.
- **Expected:** single ObligationPoint on 06-15 totaling **$2,000.00**, listing both.

### E. Weekend/holiday due date
- Issuer due date 2026-06-13 (Saturday). **Expected effective date = 2026-06-12
  (Friday)**, with an assumption string noting the conservative adjustment.
- E2: due 2026-07-04 (Saturday, also Independence Day) → effective **2026-07-02?**
  No — walk back: 07-04 Sat → 07-03 Fri is the observed federal holiday → effective
  **2026-07-02 (Thursday)**. Holiday table must include observed dates.

### F. Refund/credit after statement close
- Statement $800.00 closed 06-01; $50.00 refund posts 06-03.
- **Expected v1:** due remains **$800.00** (refund reduces current balance / next
  statement); engine attaches an informational note ("a $50.00 credit posted after
  close"). Test asserts both.

### G. Card with $0 due
- Statement balance $0.00. **Expected:** contributes $0, excluded from headline card
  list, still visible on the card detail page.

### H. Intra-period dip (the killer test)
- Today 2026-06-01. Checking $2,000.00.
- Scheduled: rent −$1,800.00 on 06-03; payroll +$2,500.00 on 06-05.
- Card1 $500.00 due 06-04; Card2 $2,000.00 due 06-10. No autopay.
- Day walk: 06-01 $2,000 → 06-03 $200 → 06-04 pay Card1 → **−$300** → 06-05 $2,200
  → 06-10 pay Card2 → $200.
- **Expected:** endpoint (06-10) is fine, but shortfall = **$300.00 on 2026-06-04**;
  headline reports the 06-04 need; intraPeriodMinimum = (2026-06-04, −$300.00 before
  remedy); transfer recommendation **$300.00 by 2026-06-03**.

### I. Minimum-payment path interest (v1 formula — documented simplification)
- Formula (binding for v1): carried = statementBalance − minimumPayment;
  monthly interest = round(carried × aprBps / 10000 / 12).
- Statement $3,000.00, min $35.00, APR 24.00% (2400 bps).
- carried = $2,965.00 → interest = 296500 × 0.02 = **$59.30** for the next cycle.
- Test also asserts the UI labels this "approximate, simple monthly interest" — the
  average-daily-balance method is a Phase 5/roadmap refinement.

### J. Pending transactions affect projection
- Checking $1,000.00 with a pending −$250.00 → projection starts from effective
  **$750.00**. Test asserts pending is applied once (not again when it posts in seed).

### §Seed-headline (compute in Phase 1)
After the seed is finalized, hand-compute the expected dashboard headline (required
amount, by-date, shortfall, recommendation) on paper from the seeded statements and
scheduled flows, record the worked arithmetic HERE in a new subsection, then encode it
as the golden integration test. The seed and this doc must always agree.

## §Money & dates (test these before anything else)

- Sign conventions: outflow negative, inflow positive; liability balances stored
  positive; net worth = Σ assets − Σ liabilities. One test fixture exercises all types.
- Rounding rule: round-half-away-from-zero to cents, applied at every materialized
  step. Test: 296500 × 0.005 / 12 style cases land deterministically.
- `addMonthsClamped('2026-01-31', 1)` → `2026-02-28`. Cycle anchored on the 31st
  produces 28/30/31-day cycles correctly across a year.
- Business-day walk-back over a weekend AND an adjacent holiday (case E2).

## §FI engine

- **FI number:** expenses $60,000/yr, SWR 400 bps → **$1,500,000.00** exactly.
  SWR 350 bps → 60000 × 10000/350 = **$1,714,285.71** (round to cent).
- **Years to FI, anchor 1 (zero return, exact):** portfolio $0, savings $1,000/mo,
  return 0%, FI $120,000 → **exactly 120 months**.
- **Years to FI, anchor 2 (pure compounding):** portfolio $500,000, savings $0,
  return 7.2%/yr (geometric monthly rate (1.072)^(1/12) − 1), FI $1,000,000 →
  doubling: m/12 ≥ ln 2 / ln 1.072 = 9.968 yr → first month where portfolio ≥ target
  is **month 120**.
- **Opportunity-cost FV, anchor (exact):** $100/mo, 12 months, 12%/yr nominal,
  i = 1%/mo, end-of-month contributions:
  FV = 100 × ((1.01^12 − 1)/0.01) = 100 × 12.682503 = **$1,268.25**.
- **Opportunity-cost regression:** $189/mo, 25 yr, 7%/yr nominal (i = 0.07/12,
  end-of-month) ≈ **$153,101** — recompute exactly with the implemented formula, verify
  it lands within $153,000–$153,300, then pin the exact cent value as the regression
  expectation and record it here.
- **Savings rate:** month with after-tax income $6,000.00 and expenses $4,200.00 →
  **30.00%**. Transfers between own accounts excluded from both sides (test with a
  $500 savings transfer present — rate unchanged).
- **Coast FI:** current portfolio $200,000, FI $1,000,000, return 7.2% geometric,
  target age in 25 yr: need (1.072)^t ≥ 5 → t = ln 5 / ln 1.072 = 23.15 yr ≤ 25 →
  **already Coast FI today**. Negative case: portfolio $100,000 → t = ln 10 / ln 1.072
  = 33.1 yr > 25 → not Coast FI; engine reports the contribution still required.

## §Categorization (Phase 2 targets)

- Normalization fixture (≥40 rows) — examples that MUST map correctly:
  `SQ *BLUE BOTTLE 0042 OAK` → Blue Bottle Coffee; `TST* HATTIE BS - ATL` → Hattie B's;
  `AMZN Mktp US*2K4XY1` → Amazon; `PAYPAL *SPOTIFYUSA` → Spotify;
  `HMSHOST-ATL-T4-POS118` → Airport Dining; `COSTCO GAS #1234` → Costco Gas (distinct
  merchant from `COSTCO WHSE #1234` → Costco).
- Review-rate test: most recent 60 seed days, `needsReview` count / total **< 5%**.
- Contextual rules: Amazon < $40 → Household, > $400 → Electronics, between → review;
  weekend-only rule; account-scoped rule; priority ordering test (user rule > merchant
  default > suggestion).
- Recurring: detects ≥8 subscriptions, the engineered price increase (old vs new amount
  + `priceChangedAt`), the 90-day-unused subscription, biweekly payroll cadence.

## §Coach copy guardrails

`coach-copy.test.ts` asserts: no banned phrases (e.g., "you wasted", "stop buying",
"guilty", "shame", "you should have"), and every projection string matches
`/assum(es|ing|ptions)/i` or renders with an attached assumptions component.
